ADO.NET is a data access technology that has been widely used in the .NET ecosystem for many years. It provides a set of classes and libraries that enable developers to interact with various data sources, including relational databases. While ADO.NET has its own advantages, it's worth comparing it with other data access technologies like Entity Framework (EF) and LINQ to SQL to understand their respective benefits and limitations.

Benefits of ADO.NET:
1. Control and Flexibility: ADO.NET offers fine-grained control over data access operations. Developers have direct access to the underlying database connection, transactions, and command execution, allowing for precise control over the data access process.
2. Performance: Due to its lightweight nature, ADO.NET can be highly performant, especially in scenarios that require fine-tuning and optimization. It allows developers to optimize queries, manage connections efficiently, and handle data in a more granular manner.
3. Familiarity and Compatibility: ADO.NET has been around for a long time and is deeply integrated into the .NET framework. Many developers are already familiar with ADO.NET, and it works well with various data sources, including not only databases but also XML files, flat files, and more.

Limitations of ADO.NET:
1. Boilerplate Code: ADO.NET requires developers to write a significant amount of code to handle common data access tasks. This can result in verbose and repetitive code, especially for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
2. Object-Relational Mapping: ADO.NET does not provide built-in support for object-relational mapping (ORM), which is a technique used to map database entities to object-oriented models. Developers need to manually handle the mapping between database tables and their corresponding object representations.
3. Learning Curve: ADO.NET has a steeper learning curve compared to higher-level ORMs like Entity Framework or LINQ to SQL. Developers need to have a good understanding of database concepts and SQL to effectively use ADO.NET.

Benefits of Entity Framework (EF) and LINQ to SQL:
1. Rapid Development: EF and LINQ to SQL provide higher-level abstractions that simplify data access tasks. They automatically generate object models from the database schema and handle the mapping between objects and relational data, reducing the amount of boilerplate code required.
2. Object-Relational Mapping: EF and LINQ to SQL offer robust ORM capabilities, allowing developers to work with object-oriented models directly without worrying about low-level data access details. They handle relationships, lazy loading, and database synchronization transparently.
3. LINQ Integration: Both EF and LINQ to SQL support Language-Integrated Query (LINQ), which enables developers to write type-safe queries using C# or VB.NET directly in their code. This results in more readable and maintainable code, with compile-time validation and intellisense support.

Limitations of Entity Framework (EF) and LINQ to SQL:
1. Performance Overhead: The abstraction layers provided by EF and LINQ to SQL can introduce a performance overhead compared to ADO.NET. While EF has improved significantly in terms of performance, it may not match the fine-grained control and performance optimizations that can be achieved with ADO.NET in certain scenarios.
2. Complexity: EF and LINQ to SQL can introduce additional complexity, especially for complex data models or scenarios that deviate from the default conventions. Understanding the underlying behavior and configuration options of these frameworks can be challenging for beginners.
3. Compatibility and Legacy Systems: Although EF and LINQ to SQL support a wide range of databases, they may not be compatible with all legacy systems or non-relational data sources. In such cases, ADO.NET provides a more flexible and compatible approach.

In summary, ADO.NET offers control, performance, and compatibility.
